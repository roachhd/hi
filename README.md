I've noticed many designers and developers have very minimal landing pages for their personal websites. This signing simplicity entices the user to click further.

This is my attempt at minimal landing/home pages. 
Most I've designed myself, but they are all heavily (very heavy) influenced by all the sites I've been browsing.
The ones that are exact replicas are referenced along with the applicable copyright ©.

Please feel free to check them out, and I'd the © is good, use them for some of your own projects.

📝 *note* 
Three are all just in plain old `HTML` but I will be making them into `Jekyll` themes soon.
